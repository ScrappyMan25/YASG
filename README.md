# YASG - Yet Another Space Game Minigame.

Yet Another Space Game - First game I've Made using the Godot Game Engine in 3 Days. 

* Theme: MiniGame
* Preface: Game a Week - Week 1
* Engine Used: GODOT

## About

#### Concept
Match the color and position of the wormhole (spinning Colored Godot Logo)

#### Controls:
* Left and Right	-> Change Position
* Up And Down	-> Change Color

#### DISCLAIMER

This was really a proof of concept/learning Godot Engine Project.

I prioritized more about the process of Game Dev Life Cycle and Modular Game Development than polish and Art so - that is quite minimalistic.

### Personal Note
* Absolutely Loved the experience of working on Godot. The design philosophy ground up is extremmly forgiving towards a new User.

* GDScript was really easy to pick up and the in-Built IDE and Documentation are REALLY USEFUL.

* Concept to implementation process was quite seemless because of the modular design structure you need to make games on godot.

* Lastly - Its amazing how light the engine runs.

* Ran into an issue with Instances - But once i understood how they worked the issue was in my implementation of PhysicsObjects.
* Ran into an issue with Collisions - The documentation had a Seperate highlighted warning asking me not to do EXACTLY what i had done so that was an easy Fix.
* Still a bit confused Between an Instance and a Class.
* Had issues with PhysicsBodies2D and forces VS transforms - which led me to realise->
* Understood that my knowledge of Physics is lacking so I need to look up theNatureOfCode and revise.
